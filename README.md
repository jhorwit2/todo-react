todo-react
==========

### Introduction 
This is a toy application so that I can play with react. I'm also leveraging
backbone for the MC part of my MVC architecture. 

This is a very 'dumb' application in that it's just a simple HTML/CSS/JS application
with no inherit server to serve the data. Please look at the install section for my
recommendation to tinker with the application

TODO: Add the logic to make this a simple expressjs application

### Install
Download the repository to your localhost
```
git cone https://github.com/jhorwit2/todo-react.git
```

To serve the data you can use the python command below
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

### Demo
TODO: serve it on my public digital ocean account
